# ETFCalc

## Objective
An [exchange traded fund (etf)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund) holds a number of underlying stocks. This tool attempts to simplify viewing the portion of a portfolio that is made up by the underlying stocks of ETFs. The tool allows a user to enter the list of stocks and ETFs held in their portfolio and will then calculate and output the percentage of the portfolio that each underlying stock makes up.

##  Steps Taken
I used this project to familiarize myself with web development and the flask framework. Stock price data is retrieved from yahoo finance through the use of Pandas Datareader. ETF holdings are currently scraped from http://etfdb.com through python requests.
